# Market-basket-Analysis

This repository showcases a Market Basket Analysis project, leveraging the Apriori algorithm to uncover association rules and frequent itemsets within transactional data. The project employs Python and a suite of libraries including Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual insights, and MLxtend for the implementation of the Apriori algorithm and association rule mining. Key steps involve data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis, followed by the utilization of the Apriori algorithm to identify frequently co-occurring items. The findings are then visualized to present actionable insights into consumer behavior patterns. This project is ideal for those interested in data science, specifically in the areas of data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and the practical application of machine learning algorithms for market analysis.
